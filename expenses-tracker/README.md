## What I Learned

### TypeScript

- Complex type definitions: `Transaction`, `Month`
- Type unions: `type: "income" | "expense"`
- String literal types: `ExpensesCategory`, `IncomeCategory`
- Optional properties: `closedAt?: string`
- Type exports and imports: `import type { Month, Transaction }`
- Omit utility type: `Omit<Transaction, "id">`
- Function typing with complex parameters
- Props interfaces for multiple components

### React Hooks

- `useState` - managing months, transactions, modals, and active month
- `useEffect` - syncing with localStorage on data changes
- Lazy initialization with functions in useState
- Functional state updates with `map()` and `filter()`
- Multiple useEffect hooks for different concerns
- Dependencies array optimization

### Component Architecture

- **Component composition** - breaking down complex UI
- **Modal patterns** - reusable modal wrapper component
- **Prop drilling** vs. **callback props**
- **Controlled components** - forms and inputs
- **Conditional rendering** - showing/hiding modals
- **Component isolation** - separating concerns

### Data Management

- **localStorage** - saving and loading complex data structures
- **JSON serialization/deserialization** for objects
- **UUID generation** with crypto.randomUUID()
- **Immutable updates** - spreading objects and arrays
- **Derived state** - calculating stats from transactions
- **Multi-entity relationships** - months containing transactions
- **Data validation** - checking setup completion

### State Management Patterns

- **Lifting state up** - managing state at App level
- **State updates** - immutably updating nested data
- **Array transformations** - map, filter for state updates
- **State initialization** - loading from localStorage on mount
- **Boolean flags** - for modal visibility and closed months

### Business Logic

- **Month lifecycle** - creation, usage, and closing
- **Transaction CRUD** - Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Balance calculation** - start balance + income - expenses
- **Date handling** - storing and displaying dates
- **Categories** - predefined and custom categories
- **Initial setup flow** - wizard pattern

### CSS

- CSS gradients `linear-gradient()`
- Flexbox layouts for responsive design
- CSS Grid for component layout
- Modal overlay with backdrop-filter
- Transitions for smooth interactions
- Hover effects for buttons and items
- Box-shadow for depth and elevation
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Responsive design with media queries

---

## Main Components

### App.tsx

Main application component with:

- Month state management (array of months)
- Active month tracking
- Transaction CRUD operations
- Modal state management
- localStorage synchronization
- Initial setup flow control

### Header.tsx

Displays financial overview:

- Current month name
- Total income (green)
- Total expenses (red)
- Current balance
- Month management buttons

### SideBar.tsx

Navigation component:

- List of all months
- Active month highlighting
- Create new month button
- Month switching functionality

- Category dropdown
- Custom category input
- Description field
- Date picker
- Form validation
```

### TransactionList.tsx

Lists all transactions:

- Grouped display of transactions
- Income items (green indicators)

---

## Design

- Clean card-based layout with shadows
- Smooth modal animations with backdrop blur
- Responsive button styles with hover effects
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive iconography
- Accessible color contrasts

---

## Screenshots

The app includes:

- **Header**: Shows current balance, income, and expenses with color coding
- **Sidebar**: Monthly navigation with visual status indicators
- **Transaction Form**: Clean input form with type toggle
- **Transaction List**: Organized list of all income and expenses
- **Modals**: Smooth overlay modals for editing and confirmations
- **Initial Setup**: Welcome wizard for first-time setup

## Key Features Explained

### Month Management

Each month has its own balance and transactions. You can:

- Create new months
- Switch between months
- Close months to prevent further edits
- Each month tracks its start balance

### Transaction Categories

**Income:** Salary, Side Job, Debt repayment, or custom

**Expenses:** Food, Shopping, Taxi, Fuel, Entertainment, Bills, Subscriptions, or custom

### Balance Calculation

```text
Current Balance = Start Balance + Total Income - Total Expenses
```

### Data Persistence

All data is automatically saved to localStorage:

- All months and their transactions
- Active month selection
- Setup completion status

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add transaction search and filtering
- [ ] Export data to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Budget goals and alerts
- [ ] Charts and visual analytics
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Recurring transaction templates
- [ ] Tags for better categorization
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
